                    <p>As we think about the future of the workplace, we recognise that while physical distancing may be
                        part of our new normal, collaboration and human connection will remain more important than ever.
                        That’s why we’re increasing sanitisation, prioritising personal space and implementing
                        behavioural signage – ensuring that members can continue working in safe and clean environments.

                        The following outlines our plans and strategies for enhancing our spaces and services. As we
                        continue to build on this foundation with industry experts and partners, we will provide ongoing
                        updates.</p>

                            <p>Members can expect heightened cleaning and hygiene standards that align with guidance
                                provided by global health organisations. By implementing professional distancing
                                standards and strategically placed behavioural and wayfinding signage, members can
                                collaborate in person with more comfort and peace of mind. Whether it’s to house
                                dispersed teams, quickly adapt spatial layouts or avoid long-term commitments,
                                businesses of all sizes are seeking greater flexibility when it comes to their workplace

                                changed – WeWork’s promise to deliver exceptional, innovative and safe spaces, has not.’
